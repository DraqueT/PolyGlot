<h3>Introduction</h3>
</div>
            
            
<p>
                A number of people are using POI for a variety of purposes.  As with
                any new API or technology, the first question people generally ask
                is not "how can I" but rather "Who else is doing what I'm about to
                do?"  This is understandable with the abysmal success rate in the
                software business.  These case statements are meant to help create
                confidence and understanding.

<p>
                We are actively seeking case studies for this page (after all it
                just started). To submit a case study, either

<h4>REWOO Scope</h4>
</div>
              
<p>
              
<a href="http://www.rewoo.de/">REWOO Scope</a> is a modern and easy to use web-based enterprise content management system. It supports knowledge workers and managers in making the right decisions based upon all relevant information.
              </p>
              
<p>
              The system uses Apache POI to extract information stored within excel files and use it transparently within REWOO Scope. Thus, POI allows our customers to work in their standard office environment while also having all important information in the REWO Scope system.

<h4>QuestionPro</h4>
</div>
              
<p>
              
<a href="http://www.questionpro.com">QuestionPro</a> is an online service allowing businesses and individuals to create, deploy and do in-depth analysis of Online Surveys. The technology is build on open-source frameworks like Struts, Velocity, POI, Lucene ... the List goes on.  The application deployment is on a Linux Application Cluster farm with a Mysql database.
              </p>
              
<p>
              There are quite a few competitors delivering similar solutions using Microsoft Technologies like asp and .net. One of the distinct advantages our competitors had over us was the ability to generate Excel Spreadsheets, Access Databases (MDB) etc. on the fly using the Component Object Model (COM) - since their servers were running IIS and they had access to the COM registry and such.
              </p>
              
<p>
              QuestionPro's initial solution was to generate CSV files. This was easy however it was a cumbersome process for our clients to download the CSV files and then import them into Excel. Moreover, formatting information could not be preserved or captured using the CSV format.  This is where POI came to our rescue. With a POI based solution, we could generate a full report with multiple sheets and all the analytical reports. To keep the solution scalable, we had a dedicated cluster for generating out the reports.
              </p>
              
<p>

              The Apache-POI project has helped QuestionPro compete with the other players in the marketplace with proprietary technology. It leveled the playing field with respect to reporting and data analysis solutions. It helped in opening doors into closed solutions like Microsoft's CDF. Today about 100 excel reports are generated daily, each with about 10-30 sheets in them.

<p>
           
<a href="http://www.sunshinesys.com/">Sunshine Systems</a> deveveloped a
            POI based reporting solution for a price optimization software package which
            is used by major retail chains.
         </p>
         
<p>The solution allowed the retailer's merchandise planners and managers to request a
           markdown decision support reports and price change reports using a standard browser
           The users could specify report type, report options, as well as company,
division,
           and department filter criteria. Report generation took place in the
multi-threaded
           application server and was capable of supporting many simultaneous report requests.
         </p>
         
<p>The reporting application collected business information from the price
optimization
           application's Oracle database. The data was aggregated and summarized
 based upon the
           specific report type and filter criteria requested by the user. The
final report was
           rendered as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet using the POI HSSF API and
 was stored on
           the report database server for that specific user as a BLOB. Reports
 could be
           seamlessly and easily viewed using the same browser.
         </p>
         
<p>The retailers liked the solution because they had instantaneous access
 to critical
           business data through an extremely easy to use browser interface. They
 did not need
           to train the broader user community on all the complexities of the optimization
           application. Furthermore, the reports were generated in an Excel spreadsheet
format,
           which everyone was familiar with and which also allowed further data
 analysis using
           standard Excel features.

<!--                    Bit Tracker (http://www.bittracker.com/) is the world's first and only web-based drill bit tracking system to manage your company's critical bit information and use that data to its full potential. It manages all bit related data, including their usage, locations, how they were used, and results such as rate of penetration and dull grade after use.  This data needs to be available in Excel format for backwards compatibility and other uses in the industry.  After using CSV and HTML formats, we needed something better for creating the spreadsheets and POI is the answer.  It works great and was easy to implement.  Kudos to the POI team.-->

<p>
                    Edwards and Kelcey Technology (http://www.ekcorp.com/) developed a
                    Facility
                    Managament and Maintenance System for the Telecommunications industry
                    based
                    on Turbine and Velocity. Originally the invoicing was done with a simple
                    CSV
                    sheet which was then marked up by accounts and customized for each client.
                    As growth has been consistent with the application, the requirement for
                    invoices that need not be touched by hand increased. POI provided the
                    solution to this issue, integrating easily and transparently into the
                    system. POI HSSF was used to create the invoices directly from the server
                    in
                    Excel 97 format and now services over 150 unique invoices per month.

                    collection web service Data Collector 3.0.  The POI team's assistance
                    allowed ClickFind to give their clients a data format that requires less
                    technical expertise than the XML format used by the Data Collector
                    application.  This was important to ClickFind as many of their current
                    and potential clients are already using Excel in their day-to-day

        The product name is 'iEXL' and has been live on both European and North American systems for over four years. 
        It is being used in preference to more established commercial products which our clients have already purchased. 
        This is due to cost and ease of use. 
      </p>  
      
<p>
        All spreadsheets can be archived if required so that historical spreadsheets can be retrieved. 
      </p>
      
<p>
        The system has benefits for all departments within an organisation. 
        Examples of this are accounts department for things such as aged trial balance, 
        distribution department for ASN&rsquo;s, warehousing for stock figures, IS for security reporting etc.   
      </p>
      
<p>
        Clients have at this point (June 2012) created over 300 spreadsheets which in turn have generated over 
        500,000  E-mails. iEXL has a menu driven email system.  
      </p>
      
<p>
        Due to the Apache-POI project IDD have been able to create the IEXL product. 
        This is a well priced product which allows companies of all sizes access to a product that opens up their reporting capabilities
      </p>

        Within the <a href="http://www.iexlsoftware.com/">iEXLSOFTWARE.COM</a> website you will find a full user manual, 
        installation instructions, a call log (Ticket) system and a downloadable 45 day trial version.

<p>
            
<a href="http://uglyduckling.nl/">Ugly Duckling</a> focus on Software, Management and Finance. 
            We have recently been using Apache POI to create tools for the mortgage group of 
            <a href="https://www.abnamro.nl/en/personal/index.html">ABN AMRO</a> in the Netherlands. 
            During this project we created a number of what we call 'Robots' using the HSSF API.
          </p>
          
<p>
            These <a href="http://uglyduckling.nl/work/robots/">robots</a> run as services on the network and 
            help automate the processing of large amounts of data. Our Robots can be used to spot problems that 
            a human might not, and also to automate repetitive tasks.
          </p>
          
<p>
            We found Apache POI to be extremely useful. We took the base API, wrapped it in a builder pattern and 
            thus created a DSL with a fluid interface. Throughout the project we enjoyed very much working with 
            Apache POI and found it to be very reliable.
