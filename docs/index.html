<a id="polyglot---introduction" class="anchor" href="#polyglot---introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PolyGlot - Introduction</h3>

<p>PolyGlot is a tool that is designed to help in the design, creation, and publication of constructed languages, or "conlangs." 
    When I first got into language creation, I realized that there were no tools available that really met all of my needs. So 
    I made one! Below, you'll find a list of its features, and if there's functionality you would like to see added, please 
    feel free to <a href="https://github.com/DraqueT/PolyGlot/issues/new">request a new feature!</a> PolyGlot is free and open 
    source software that contains no advertising or other gross stuff. It is compatible with Windows, OSX, and Linux. Please enjoy!</p>

<h3>
<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>A lexicon with advanced search, classification, and word creation capabilities</li>
<li>A grammar guide/syntax repository with complex formatting and search functionality</li>
<li>User definable orthography, with automatic  generation of word pronunciations (regular expression compatible for deep orthographies)</li>
<li>Support for lexicon imports from Excel sheets and CSV files</li>
<li>Full word class system</li>
<li>Full Part of Speech system, including enforced conjugation/declension rules and auto-generation of word forms</li>
<li>Formatted publishing to PDF, generating dictionaries (both conlang to natural language, and vice versa), chapter format for all grammar sections, gloss keys, orthographic rules, etc.</li>
<li>A statistical language analysis tool</li>
<li>An Etymology Engine with graphical generation of etymology trees</li>
<li>Customizable character macros, for difficult to type languages using many diacritic marks</li>
<li>Support for importing and embedding custom fonts (useful for languages with nonstandard or custom character sets)</li>
<li>User definable parts of speech with integrated glossing system</li>
<li>User definable rules for declension/conjugation, which automatically generate all legal forms of words</li>
<li>Conjugation rule debug window for the construction of highly complex conjugation/declension rule sets</li>
<li>Full logographic engine for languages that incorporate abstract symbols or entirely ideographic writing systems</li>
<li>Fully formatable grammar section, allowing language rules to be elegantly broken into chapters</li>
<li>Recording and playback of spoken examples within the grammar section</li>
<li>Supports exporting lexicon to Excel</li>
<li>Interactive IPA chart with spoken examples and characters copied to clipboard (courtesy of <a href="http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/">http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/</a>)</li>
<li>Language statistics window for analysis of current lexicon</li>
<li>RTL character direction enforcement for applicable languages (useful with custom scripts)</li>
<li>Lexical consistency check tool to ensure compliance to language rules as you evolve them</li>

<a id="future-development" class="anchor" href="#future-development" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Future Development</h3>

<p>I plan on continuing to develop and refine PolyGlot so long as there's a healthy conlanging community and people who seem to be enjoying the program. Please feel free to suggest changes/enhancements, request new features, or just drop me a line to show off what you've created with the tool! </p>
