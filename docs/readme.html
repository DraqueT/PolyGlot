                                source</a>
                            tool set that helps to build constructed languages! PolyGlot
                            is a project that I have been working on for some time, and it
                            continues to become stable and capable with each release. If you
                            have ideas, find bugs, or have any comments at all, please feel free to
                            email me at <a href="mailto:draquemail@gmail.com">draquemail@gmail.com</a>!</div>

                        <h1><a name="-----_ii_-----"></a>WHAT’S NEW</h1>
                        <div align ="left"><br>The under the hood bug-fixes and 
                            modifications this time around were massive. There were serious issues with data
                            persistence corrected, numerous UI failings addressed, and countless minor bugs. In
                            the process of the UI rewrite, a LOT of very old code was replaced. For every
                            visible upgrade to PolyGlot this time around, there were a dozen tweaks to behavior
                            that the end user will hopefully never notice. There's a reason this is being marked
                            as 2.0.<br><br>

                            The biggest improvement to PolyGlot is obviously the UI. This time around it is
                            completely revamped. Almost all of the changes are based on user requests that I've
                            gotten over time, and I am hoping that the new design significantly improves workflow
                            within the system. In addition to this, there are some new features to play with as well!
                            I have updated the class system to allow for free text classes. These classes are simply
                            blank text fields added to words in your lexicon (as with the original classes, they can
                            be assigned to particular parts of speech).

                            The Windows frontend should make things much easier for those of you on Microsoft OSes. 
                            It will associate itself with the PGD filetype, given them a nifty little icon, and 
                            open them in PolyGlot automatically when they are double clicked.

                            A much requested feature was a way to eliminate deprecated wordforms. Although sometimes
                            these can be useful when revaming a system that includes manual exceptions to rules, it's
                            often just a pain. In the conjugations/declensions window, I've added a button that will
                            purge all deprecated wordforms for a given part of speech.<br><br>
                        </div>

                        <a name="INSTALLATION"></a>
                        <h1>INSTALLATION</h1><br>
                        <div align ="left">PolyGlot is a Java program, and requires the Java Virtual Machine 1.8
                            or higher to run. This is available for free at <a href="https://java.com/en/download/index.jsp">https://java.com/en/download/index.jsp</a>.
                            PolyGlot will run on any version of Java newer than Java 1.8, but it is
                            recommended that you have the highest version your operating system
                            will support. NOTE: Most operating systems should be able to unzip files,
                            but programs such as <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7Zip</a> are available online for free.<br>
                            PolyGlot <span style="font-style: italic;">MUST</span> be
                            unzipped to function correctly. It cannot be run from within the zip
                            file that you've downloaded, and many of its functions will fail in
                            unpredictable ways if you attempt to run it directly from the zip file.</div>
                        <br><br>
                        WINDOWS:
                        <br>
                        <div align ="left">If Java is installed, you only need to unzip the contents of the
                            PolyGlot program to a folder and double click the frontend executable file.
                            This will associate PGT filetypes with the frontend so that double clicking
                            opens them correctly. <br><br>
                            <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS WITH WINRAR</span>:
                            WinRAR tends to associate itself with jar files as archives. This keeps them
                            from executing properly. Follow these instructions to correct the issue.<br></div>
                        <div align ="left"><ul>
                                <li>Open WinRAR</li>

                            </ul>
                            After this, simply double click PolyGlot.jar and it should open up for you!</div>

                        LINUX:<br>
                        <div align ="left">Simply unzip the files where you like and run! For convenience, there is a script
                            which opens PolyGlot included.

                            <br><br>
                            <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE FOR LINUX USERS</span>: Before
                            using PolyGlot, most users of Linux will have to make the jar file
                            executable. To do this, open a command prompt, navigate to the folder
                            you have extracted PolyGlot to, and enter the following line: "chmod +x
                            PolyGlot.jar". Depending on your settings, you may need to enter your
                            admin password to do this.<br>
                            <br>
                            Additionally, some builds of Linux come with OpenJDK 7, which does not
                            include JavaFX (a necessary component for PolyGlot's interface). Please
                            upgrade to OpenJDK 8 if you're using Linux and still on 7. This can be
                            done through the Package Manager and search for JavaFX or the full
                            name, java-openjfx.<br>
                            <br>
                            <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE FOR ARCH LINUX USERS: </span>You
                            must install JFX manually to properly use PolyGlot.<br></div>

                            word legality elsewhere, but the ConWord being more than a blank space
                            is one unalterable rule.<br>

                            typical for users to define phonemic orthographies which will auto-populate this
                            field. If you select the checkbox beneath the pronunciation
                            field, pronunciation auto-generation will be

                            The Override Lexical Rules checkbox will tell PolyGlot that you wish to enter a
                            word which breaks typical rules, and will unlock the lexicon list, even
                            if the word would otherwise be illegal.<br>
                            <br>
                            In the definition field, you can write a more freeform definition of

                            be created here. Once created, they will populate in the drop down
                            boxes of the main screen. You can name the types and add notes as is
                            appropriate. Types can be added and deleted with the respective buttons
                            on the above screen.<br>

                            <br>It is worth noting that <i>classes</i> of words (such as gender) should
                            not be created here. Their creation is handled elsewhere in PloyGlot and covered
                            later in this document.

                            ".*ru$" would tell PolyGlot that all words of a given type must end in
                            the characters "ru". The pattern shown in the above illustration enforces
                            the rule that verbs must end with the character for "lo" in Lodenkur.<br>

                            vs. past tense, but there are many different ways that a conjugation
                            can encode meaning in a language. It is in the cases of a more complex

                            PolyGlot is the Autogeneration system for conjugations and declensions.
                            This section goes through a basic setup to create a conjugation system.
                            The dictionary used here as an example is included along with PolyGlot
                            as the file exampleAutoGen.pgt. For those of you unfamiliar with
                            regular expressions, links to excellent tutorials exist in the <a href="readme.html#ADDITIONAL_RESOURCES">Additional Resources</a>

                        <br>

                            for a type must exist (as explained in <a href="readme.html#-_ConjugationsDeclensions">Conjugations/Declensions</a>).
                            Once this is done, go to the Types tab, select the part of speech to

                        <br>
                        <div align ="left">A number of controls are presented here. In the leftmost column, you see
                            every possible conjugation of the selected word type (verb in this
                            example case). The verb selected to create a conjugation rule is past tense
                            verbs that are certain and positive. Every possible combination of conjugations
                            is present in this list. A combination can be disabled by clicking the "Disable
                            Wordform" checkbox.<br>

                            To create transformation rules click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">+</span>
                            button beneath the rules column. In the example picture, one rule,
                            "Past, Cert, Pos rule" has been created. The rightmost section of the window contains
                            the rule's properties. Of note is that you may create as many rules as you like
                            for each conjugation. They will be applied in the order that they appear in the rules
                            list. Their order can be adjusted using the up and down arrow buttons immediately
                            to the right of the Rules list.<br>

                            The rule's name can be set to anything, and is just label
                            to help remember what precisely it applies to. The
                            rule regex immediately below its name dictates which words the rule applies to.
                            In the example, I use the regex ".*" which applies to everything. If you used the match
                            regex ".ru$", the rule would only be aplied to rules ending with "ru". Regex is a
                            very powerful system, but can be confusing at first. There are links at the end of this
                            document which lead to helpful guides with it if you are unfamiliar.<br>

                            <br>
                            Beneath this is the Transformations table. Each rule may have as many
                            transformations as you like. They will be applied as with the rules themselves,
                            they are applied in the order which they appear. For conjugations with complex
                            transformations, this can make things much simpler.
                            Here, there is only one rule. As you can see, PolyGlot natively applies any 
                            script directly to the column to allow for natively legible characters (scripts
                            must be imported as fonts, which is covered elsewhere in this document). The left
                            column is the Regex value for the transformation. This is the section of the word
                            that PolyGlot will target to replace. In my example it looks for the character "lo" in 
                            my script at the end of words. The right column contains the text that will replace 
                            the text targetted in the left column.

                            Here is the complete logic that this rule will result in when PolyGlot looks to create
                            conjugations for verbs:

                            <ul>
                                <li>Is this word a verb? If so, continue.</li>
                                <li>Create a Past Certain Positive conjugation field for the word</li>
                                <li>Are rules available which the word matches the rule regex fits? If so, apply those rules to the word</li>
                                <li>For each rule whhich applies to the word, apply each transformation in the order they appear</li>
                                <li>For each transformation, target matching regex text and overwrite it with the replacement text</li>
                                <li>The resulting text is your fully conjugated wordform.</li>
                            </ul></div>

                            - Conlang Font<br>
                            Many ConLangs use nonstandard character sets, and it is sometimes
                            easiest to simply create a font yourself and map these characters to
                            standard Unicode characters. To load a font, click the Conlang Font
                            button and select from the list of locally installed fonts. All Conlang
                            fields will appear in the appropriate font. As a note, if you wish to
                            send your saved dictionary to a friend who is also using PolyGlot, you
                            must also send them the font, or they will receive an error message
                            when they load your dictionary, and see standard characters, rather
                            than your custom font.<br>

                            - Alphabetical Order<br>
                            This allows you to create a custom
                            alphabetical order for the
                            characters used in your language. Simply list the characters in your
                            alphabetical order in this text box, and PolyGlot will respect it when
                            reordering words in the dictionary. Any characters not provided here
                            will be ordered in standard fashion (as decided by your operating
                            system). Here, I have set the alphabetic order to follow qwerty. This
                            will order the dictionary and any alphabetically ordered fields with
                            the order you provide.<br></div>

                            settings. Here, you can tell PolyGlot to enforce rules within your
                            lexicon. If <span style="font-weight: bold;">Part of Speech Mandatory</span> is
                            selected, all words must have a type set to be saved. If <span style="font-weight: bold;">Local Mandatory</span> is set, all words
                            must have a Local Word property set to be saved. If <span style="font-weight: bold;">Word Uniqueness </span>is set, homonyms
                            within your conlang will be forbidden. If <span style="font-weight: bold;">Local Uniqueness</span>

                            is set, no two constructed words may contain identical text for their
                            Local Word property. If you create a word that violates any rules that
                            you have chosen to enforce, PolyGlot will prevent you from selecting
                            other words until it is corrected, and display an error message telling
                            you what to do to correct this.<br>

                            If your language uses Right to Left style writing, select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Enforce RTL </span>checkbox. This will
                            make instances of your conlang appear/be written in the correct

                            Here, you map columns from your excel sheet to fields in PloyGlot. The

                            mapping. Remember, in Excel, column numbers begin at 0, rather than 1.
                            If you have more columns than are provided for in PolyGlot, multiple
                            columns can be imported to a single PolyGlot field. Simply enter the

                            These can be easily renamed to their appropriate values post import

                        <div align ="left">The above image shows the Character Pronunciation guide. New rows can
                        be added with the Add button, and selected columns can be deleted with
                        the Delete button. The Character(s) row represents one character or a
                        series of characters that make up a sound or phoneme. The Pronunciation
                        column represents the sound or phoneme associated with the contents of
                        the Character(s) column of the same row. This allows PolyGlot to
                        auto-generate pronunciations for you when you create new words, and can
                        save a lot of time. Both columns are compatible with regular
                        expressions (explained below).<br>
                        <br>
                        Of note is the both upper and lower cases must be entered into the

                        The order that the sets appear in represents their <span style="font-style: italic;">priority</span>.
                        Higher position means higher priority. In the example, you can see that
                        the pair "gh-&gt;j" is higher than both "g-&gt;guh" and "h-&gt;h". This
                        means that if PolyGlot encounters "gh", it will attempt to create a
                        valid pronunciation using the "gh-&gt;j" rule before either of the
                        others. By selecting a row and clicking the up or down arrow to the
                        right of the guide, you can move a set to higher or lower priorities in
                        the guide. <br>

                        <br>
                        In addition to the basic functionality, the pronunciation guide is
                        compatible with regular expressions. For example, if you added the pair
                        "^th" -&gt; "θ", it would replace "th" <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span>
                        when it appeared at the beginning of a word. This allows for deep
                        orthographies to be easily be created. Links in the references section

                            integer values. This represents the number of strokes that a logograph
                            takes to write. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Is Radical</span>
                            checkbox is used to mark whether the current logograph is used as a
                            radical in the construction of more complex logographs. If this is
                            selected, you will be able to add the character to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Radicals</span> list of other words.<br>

                            Guide will have its own chapter in the ToC, with subchapters listed

                                On the left is the chapter and section tree. By clicking the Chapter
                                button, a new chapter is added below the currently selected position.
                                Chapters cannot be nested. The + button adds new sections to the
                                currently selected chapter. The - button deletes a chapter or section.
                                Delete with care, PolyGlot has no undo!<br>

                                The name field allows you to name your chapter/section.<br>
                                <br>
                                The text field allows you to write out grammar rules. Text format can
                                be modified by highlighting text, changing the values of the font menu
                                above the text box, and clicking Apply. If your language uses RTL
                                writing, it will display as such here when you select your conlang's
                                font in the font dropdown.<br>

                                The Spoken Example menu allows you to record and play back speech in
                                your conlang. This is especially useful when your language uses
                                particular tones or inflections that it is difficult to describe in
                                simple text.<br>

                                The following sites are excellent for creating your
                                own fonts for use within PolyGlot, and all fonts created with them
                                should be fully compatible (although custom kerning is still a future
                                feature). The custom font for Lodenkur, Kukun Linear A, was created
                                with Fontstruct, although future versions will likely be created with
                                FontContstructor.<br>

                                The first two are resources to read through yourself, and the last is a
                                community of very friendly people who are passionate about creating and

                                are immensely powerful. Below are a few links that are very helpful in
