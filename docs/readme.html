                        <div align ="left">Welcome to PolyGlot, an <a href="https://github.com/DraqueT/PolyGlot">open source</a>
                            tool set that helps to build constructed languages! PolyGlot
                            is a project that I have been working on for some time, and it
                            continues to become more stable and capable with each release. If you
                            have ideas, find bugs, or have any comments at all, please feel free to
                            email me at <a href="mailto:draquemail@gmail.com">draquemail@gmail.com</a> or
                            post them on <a href="https://github.com/DraqueT/PolyGlot/issues">PolyGlot's issues page</a>!</div>

                        <h1><a name="-----_ii_-----"></a>WHAT’S NEW</h1>
                        <div align ="left"><br>Heyo, all! Welcome to version 3.5 of PolyGlot! This is a <b>massive</b> release! First, 
                            I want to give a huge shout out to TrapinchO over on GitHub, who gave an enormous amount of help with 
                            testing, and just has killer ideas in general! 3.5 includes a long list of upgrades and
                            bug fixes. This also represents a significant step toward an Android release of PolyGlot, which has been 
                            much requested and a long time coming.<br><br>
                            
                            Among the most exciting upgrades are the complete integration of the Zompist word generator (algorithm
                            and original design by Mark Rosenfelder there), a complete overhaul of how graphics are painted (no
                            more CPU fans going nuts), a revamped lexicon look (local language synonyms now displayed in the list
                            by their conword counterparts), automatic syllable composition when generating pronunciations, and many, 
                            <i>many</i> quality of life improvements (full list below). And that is on top of a ton of bug fixes!<br><br>
                            
                            Please enjoy, everyone!

                            to install! PolyGlot no longer has a frontend, and to run the base program, there is no need to install

                            the characters "ru". The pattern shown in the above illustration enforces
                            the rule that verbs must end with the character for "lo" in Lodenkur.<br>

                            auto-generation of the forms is defined, each space should be filled in with the 
                            appropriately generated word form. To the top of the screen, the dimensions for 
                            the columns and the rows may be selected (if there are two or more dimensions). 
                            If there are three or more dimensions, the dimensions not chosen in either of the 
                            dropdowns is represented by a tab that can be selected. Non-dimensional word forms 
                            are displayed on their own tab, as are deprecated forms which had previously been 
                            saved.

                            One of the more complex features to
                            PolyGlot is the Auto-generation system for conjugations and declensions.
                            This section goes through a basic setup to create a conjugation system.
                            The dictionary used here as an example is included along with PolyGlot
                            as the file exampleAutoGen.pgt. For those of you unfamiliar with
                            regular expressions, links to excellent tutorials exist in the <a href="readme.html#ADDITIONAL_RESOURCES">Additional Resources</a>
                            section of this document. Additionally, there are example dictionaries
                            included with the download of PolyGlot (in the Example Lexicons folder)
                            which may be helpful with some common patterns. For those of you who 
                            who are into infixes, examples are given on how to set this up!<br></div>

                            Before continuing, consider how much complexity you will need for your word forms. Is conjugation a one step affair in your language?
                            Is it a simple swap of one pattern on the end or beginning of your words? If so, consider using the Simplified version of the 
                            auto-generation tool, which can be switched to by clicking the radio button illustrated above (which exists on the top of the 
                            auto-generation window).

                        <div align="left">
                            The Simplified Auto-Generation screen allows for fast and simple creation of basic auto-conjugation settings. If your language has 
                            simple rules for the generation of word forms, you may find this tool less cumbersome than the classic view. The left side of the 
                            window is taken up by a list of all conjugations. Only past and present exist in the example given. To the right are a few options.

                            <br><br>First is the <b>Disable Wordform</b> checkbox. Selecting this tells PolyGlot to ignore this particular conjugation. This can 
                            be useful in cases where conjugations are created dimensionally in ways that you do not need. For example, perhaps both tense and 
                            certainty of actions are encoded in your language, but all actions in the past have positive certainty. In this case, you would 
                            select Disable Wordform for the conjugation past-uncertain.

                            <br><br>Second is the <b>Regex Pattern</b> field. Regex (regular expressions) represent a powerful tool which can identify patterns. These
                            are used in PolyGlot. Simple prefix/suffix cases are covered here, but if you would like to get more ambitious, please check out 
                            the links in <a href="readme.html#ADDITIONAL_RESOURCES">Additional Resources</a>. Here, the "$" character is placed in the regex field.
                            This character represents the end of a word, so it will result in a suffix being added.

                            <br><br>The last field is the <b>Replacement Text</b> field. Text placed here will replace any parts of the original word which match the
                            regex pattern above. Here, the very end of the word (which does not include any characters) will be replaced with "-PASTO". Because the $ 
                            character only matches the end of a word itself rather than characters within it, it will add "-PASTO" as a suffix when conjugating the 
                            past tense.

                            <br><br>The two buttons on the bottom are <b>Prefix Template</b> and <b>Postfix Template</b>. These will populate the regex field with a
                            pattern telling PolyGlot to conjugate the currently selected conjugation/declension by either adding the replacement text to the beginning 
                            or the end of a base word, respectively.

                        <div align ="left">The Classic Auto-Generation setup is significantly more complex than the simplified menu. 
                            It is both more powerful and has a steeper learning curve. If your language has complex conjugation or
                            declension rules however, this will give you the power you need to implement it. If you are using the Classic
                            Auto-Generation, please also take note of the <a href="#CONJTEST">Test Menu</a>. It will prove invaluable to making certain that your 
                            rules behave in the manner which you expect them to.<br><br>

                            A number of controls are presented here. In the leftmost column, you see
                            every possible conjugation of the selected word type (verb in this
                            example case). The verb selected to create a conjugation rule is past tense
                            verbs that are certain and positive. Every possible combination of conjugations
                            is present in this list. A combination can be disabled by clicking the "Disable
                            Wordform" checkbox.<br>

                            To create transformation rules click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">+</span>
                            button beneath the rules column. In the example picture, one rule,
                            "Past, Cert, Pos rule" has been created. The rightmost section of the window contains
                            the rule's properties. Of note is that you may create as many rules as you like
                            for each conjugation. They will be applied in the order that they appear in the rules
                            list. Their order can be adjusted using the up and down arrow buttons immediately
                            to the right of the Rules list.<br>

                            The rule's name can be set to anything, and is just label
                            to help remember what precisely it applies to. The
                            rule regex immediately below its name dictates which words the rule applies to.
                            In the example, I use the regex ".*" which applies to everything. If you used the match
                            regex ".*ru$", the rule would only be applied to rules ending with "ru". Regex is a
                            very powerful system, but can be confusing at first. There are links at the end of this
                            document which lead to helpful guides with it if you are unfamiliar.<br>

                            <br>
                            Beneath this is the Transformations table. Each rule may have as many
                            transformations as you like. They will be applied as with the rules themselves,
                            they are applied in the order which they appear. For conjugations with complex
                            transformations, this can make things much simpler.
                            Here, there is only one rule. As you can see, PolyGlot natively applies any 
                            script directly to the column to allow for natively legible characters (scripts
                            must be imported as fonts, which is covered elsewhere in this document). The left
                            column is the Regex value for the transformation. This is the section of the word
                            that PolyGlot will target to replace. In my example it looks for the character "lo" in 
                            my script at the end of words. The right column contains the text that will replace 
                            the text targeted in the left column.<br><br>

                            Here is the complete logic that this rule will result in when PolyGlot looks to create
                            conjugations for verbs:

                            <ul>
                                <li>Is this word a verb? If so, continue.</li>
                                <li>Create a Past Certain Positive conjugation field for the word</li>
                                <li>Are rules available which the word matches the rule regex fits? If so, apply those rules to the word</li>
                                <li>For each rule which applies to the word, apply each transformation in the order they appear</li>
                                <li>For each transformation, target matching regex text and overwrite it with the replacement text</li>
                                <li>The resulting text is your fully conjugated word-form.</li>
                            </ul></div>

                            Often times it can be useful to filter conjugation rules by the value of a word's class.
                            For example, perhaps female nouns decline differently than male nouns. If this is the 
                            case, defined class values (Classes covered in the next section) will appear in a filter
                            box when creating rules. To apply a rule to words of all class values, simply choose "All." 
                            To apply it to specific class values, deselect all and select the values to filter for. NOTE: 
                            <b>every</b> value checked must match for the rule's transformations to be applied to a given 
                            word.

                            The auto-generation test menu is an invaluable too when creating more complex conjugation and 
                            declension rules. It provides both a test bed for the generation process and complex debug
                            output to show you exactly what is taking place when the new word forms are generated. To access
                            this menu, click the Test button in the upper right-hand corner of the Auto-Conjugation Setup

                            In the example setup, there are two conjugations: past and present. Shown are rules for the past 
                            conjugation. Selected is the rule "male starts with b." The match class value is set to male, and 
                            the regex match is set to "b.*", so this rule will apply only to words of class male that start with
                            the character 'b'. Within the rule are three transformation rules. First, appending "-PASTO" to the 
                            end of the word. Second, replacing the 'b' that the word begins with with "MALE-". Third, replacing
                            the trailing 'O' character (added by the first transformation) with a '-'.<br><br>

                            inconsistent). If your alphabet does not include all of the characters
                            appearing in your lexicon, it will be highlighted in red, and
                            Polyglot will be unable to use your alphabetic ordering.

                            - Kerning<br>
                            The default value for kerning is set to 0. Making this larger or smaller 
                            (into negatives) allows you to edit space between characters.<br>
                            <b>WARNING:</b> Kerning values over 0.0 will cause PolyGlot to ignore
                            ligatures. This is due to a problem with Java rendering that will not 
                            likely be fixed. If you are using a custom font, adjust spacing there.

                            The Swadesh List tool can be helpful when beginning a language and looking for a place to start. Swadesh lists are lists 
                            of the most fundamental words in many early languages. If these are completed, deriving newer words and expanding your
                            language may prove to be much easier. PolyGlot comes with a few predefined Swadesh lists. Selecting Tools->Swadesh Lists

                            these files must be delimited by a new line or carriage return between each word to be imported).

                            <h4>Categories</h4>
                            These are your phonological classes, defined by enumeration. For instance, I might define my fricatives like this:
                            <br>
                            F=tvszšž<br>
                            That means that any time gen wants to output an F from the syllables list, it will randomly pick one of f, v, s, z, š, ž. 
                            The phonemes in a category have to be single characters, but we’ll see how to output digraphs below.<br>

                            Order here determines the probability. The program runs through the phonemes in a category, with the default Medium setting
                            giving 30% chance of stopping after each subsequent character. The example F definition above is set up for t to occur a 
                            frequently and ž not that very infrequently. <br>

                            The main corollary: Put the sounds you like first! Don’t list them in place of articulation order unless you really like 
                            labials. Try varying the order and hitting Generate to see how changing the order changes the output.<br>

                            Don’t overdo the classes. This tool doesn’t know any phonology, and will be perfectly happy with a single class C for all 
                            consonants. You define a class for two reasons:<br>

                            1) To control probabilities. E.g. we usually want stops to occur more than fricatives.<br>
                            2) To enforce phonotactics. E.g. if the only initial clusters you allow are stop + liquid, then you need classes for stops 
                            and liquids. <br><br>
                            
                            <h4>Illegal Clusters</h4>
                            Within the illegal clusters box, you can define clusters of characters which are illegal. The generator will not create any
                            words or syllables which contain these character combinations. These rules are applied <i>after</i> the rewrite rules are
                            applied.<br><br>
                            
                            <h4>Rewrite Rules</h4>
                            This is optional functionality which can add be used to add multicharacter patterns to the output, transform special cases of
                            clusters into a single, unified character, etc. by applying global substitutions to the output. The simplest form is to replace 
                            a single character:<br>
                            θ|th <br>
                            That tells the tool to replace every occurrence of θ in the output with th. You can also handle combinations. E.g. maybe ti 
                            always changes to či. You'd write that as<br>
                            ti|či <br>
                            The rewrite rules are regex compatible. For example you could change both br and bl to bj with the formula<br>
                            b[rl]|bj<br>
                            Rules are applied in order. Take care that one intended rewrite will not simply be consumed by a later one.<br><br>

                            
                            <b>Output settings:</b> You can choose either to generate words based on the rules you define or all possible syllables.
                            Generating words will give you a randomized list of constructed words (they will not be the same if generated twice). If 
                            you generate all syllables, every possible combination of characters will be generated. This process is not random, as it
                            hits each possibility once. The syllables can be imported to allow automated pronunciation generation to separate syllables
                            automatically.<br>
                            <b>Show Syllables:</b> Selecting this will separate the syllables of each word by division dots. This option is available 
                            only for word generation.<br>
                            <b>Dropoff:</b> Under the categories definitions, characters appearing later will appear less frequently. Dropoff determines 
                            quickly this declines. If you have C=ptkbdg, then when outputing a C, normally p will appear most frequently, t a but less,
                            and so on, with g appearing the lease. If fast dropoff is selected, the probabilities will stack even more in favor of the 
                            first character (p here). With slow selected, a more even distribution will be applied. Sliding it entirely to the side will
                            make all choices equiprobable.This option is available only for word
                            generation.<br>
                            <b>Slow Syllable Dropoff:</b> The Dropoff control doesn't affect the selection of syllable types. You can choose a more even 
                            distribution by checking this. This option is available  only for word generation.<br>
                            <b>Monosyllables:</b> This slider controls how much of the output should be monosyllabic. This might be set to Always for an 
                            isolating language, for instance. This option is available  only for word generation.<br>
                            <b>Target:</b> This controls the target number of words to generate. This option is available only for word generation.

                            This is the bottom half of the word generator after a set of words has been generated. This is the section of the tool used to 
                            import words into your language. Rather than simply copying words wholesale, I recommend that you take the time to sort through
                            them, finding those whose sounds and feel you like, then pairing them with an appropriate meaning.<br>
                            <b>Generated Words:</b> This is where all generated words are placed. You may select and edit them as you like. Using the + and -
                            keys below, you may delete lines or add in new ones if the idea for a similar sounding word to one you are keeping comes to you.<br>
                            <b>Swadesh List:</b> This is an optional feature which helps to pair generated words with very basic definitions. There are two 
                            default <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadesh_list">Swadesh lists</a> that can be selected in addition to the option of 
                            loading your own, custom list (if you choose to load your own, it is simply a line delimited list of words). Words in the Swadesh
                            list may be edited, deleted, or new lines inserted via the + and - buttons below.<br>
                            <b>Words to Import:</b> This is a list of words which are ready to import into your language. To add a word, simply select an entry
                            in the Generated Words list, select a value in the Swadesh list (optionally), and click the > button. To move an entry out again,
                            select it in the Import list and click the < button. This will return the word and Swadesh value to their respective lists.<br>
                            <b>Import Words:</b> Once you have decided on which words you would like to import, click this to add them to your lexicon. The

                            The <b>Auto Resize Window</b> feature is disabled by default. This causes the PolyGlot main window to remember the 
                            size of windows within the main menu. On switching to a given window, PolyGlot will resize to the last size you set

                            <b>Default Font Size</b> controls the size which menus default to. Change it if you're having trouble with the size

                            PolyGlot defaults to saving 10 prior save versions. <b>Reversion States Saved</b> is where this number can be changed.
                            Versions older than this will be discarded. The value 0 means that PolyGlot will not limit the number of saved versions. 
                            Take care when setting the value to 0. If you have a large language file and save frequently, this can make the size of

                            but can be recovered from if it or your system crash unexpectedly. You can change the frequency of saves here in minutes.
                            Note that autosaves will not affect the revision points feature in PolyGlot that are typically created each save.<br><br>

                            mapping. Remember, in Excel, column numbers begin at 0, rather than 1.
                            If you have more columns than are provided for in PolyGlot, multiple
                            columns can be imported to a single PolyGlot field. Simply enter the

                            These can be easily renamed to their appropriate values post import

                            selected, words existing in your current language will be overwritten by
                            the values found in the file you import.

                            creating logical loops. A word may never be its own ancestor.<br><br>

                            To the bottom left is the External Parents interface. Here, you can add and 
                            remove etymological parents which exist outside your current language. Click 
                            the + button to add additional parents.<br><br>

                            In both the internal and external menus, a - button will appear next to all 
                            current parents. Click it will delete that parent from the currently selected 
                            word. Notes/images can be added in a free text menu as well.

                        <div align ="left">The above image shows the Phonemic Orthography guide.
                            This can be found by clicking the Phonology and Text menu button on the
                            left of PolyGlot's menu. It is the first of the three menus. New rows can
                            be added with the Add button, and selected columns can be deleted with
                            the Delete button. The Character(s) row represents one character or a
                            series of characters that make up a sound or phoneme. The Pronunciation
                            column represents the sound or phoneme associated with the contents of
                            the Character(s) column of the same row. This allows PolyGlot to
                            auto-generate pronunciations for you when you create new words, and can
                            save a lot of time. Both columns are compatible with regular
                            expressions (explained below).<br>
                            <br>
                            Of note is that both upper and lower cases must be entered into the
                            pronunciation guide unless both the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ignore
                                Case</span> option and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Disable
                                Proc Regex</span> options are selected.<br>
                            <br>
                            The order that the sets appear in represents their <span style="font-style: italic;">priority</span>.
                            Higher position means higher priority. In the example, you can see that
                            the pair "gh-&gt;j" is higher than both "g-&gt;guh" and "h-&gt;h". This
                            means that if PolyGlot encounters "gh", it will attempt to create a
                            valid pronunciation using the "gh-&gt;j" rule before either of the
                            others. By selecting a row and clicking the up or down arrow to the
                            right of the guide, you can move a set to higher or lower priorities in
                            the guide. <br>

                            <br>
                            In addition to the basic functionality, the pronunciation guide is
                            compatible with regular expressions. For example, if you added the pair
                            "^th" -&gt; "θ", it would replace "th" <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span>
                            when it appeared at the beginning of a word. This allows for deep
                            orthographies to be easily be created. Links in the references section
                            of this document lead to good regular expression tutorials.<br>

                            <br>
                            The last element of the pronunciation guide is the Recurse Patterns button. 
                            This enables a powerful function in PolyGlot, which will comb through a word 
                            multiple times, applying new pronunciations so long as there are more transformations
                            defined in the left column that might apply. <b>Clicking this will also enable lookahead
                                and lookbehind in regex patterns.</b>

                            The Language Evolution Tool can be used to create linguistic drift in your lexicon. With it, you can

                            regex patterns. The Part of Speech dropdown allows you to specify a particular part of speech. Words 
                            which match all values in the filter will have your transformations applied to them.<br><br>

                                bulk operation on your lexicon.<br><br>

                                The reversion menu can be accessed by clicking Tools->Revert Language, 
                                as shown above.<br><br>
                                <img src="assets/revert02.png" alt=""><br>
                                In the reversion menu, you will see prior saves (limit of prior saves
                                retained found in options menu, with 0 as infinite). They are listed
                                in in descending order of save time/date. To revert to any given 
                                state, select it and click the Revert To button.<br><br>
                                If you modify and save from this point, a <i>new</i> reversion point 
                                will be created rather than saving over the existing one you loaded. 
                                Once a reversion point is created, it is fixed in time.<br><br>
                                <br>
                                PolyGlot defaults to saving 10 prior save versions. Versions older 
                                than this will be discarded. You can increase or decrease this number
                                in the PolyGlot options menu (Tools->Options). The value 0 means that
                                PolyGlot will not limit the number of saved versions. Take care when
                                setting the value to 0. If you have a large language file and save
                                frequently, this can make the size of your language save file balloon
                                quickly.

                                The Grammar Guide allows you to organize gramatical rules of your
                                language in easy to read and traverse chapters/sections. It it a
                                powerful tool which allows complex formatting of text to best describe
                                grammar to users. To access it, click the Grammar button on the main
                                menu.<br>
                                <br>
                                <img alt="" src="assets/grammar1.png" width=700><br>

                                This window is one of the more complex elements of PolyGlot, but also
                                one of the most powerful.<br>
                                <br>
                                On the left is the chapter and section tree. By clicking the Chapter
                                button, a new chapter is added below the currently selected position.
                                Chapters cannot be nested. The + button adds new sections to the
                                currently selected chapter. The - button deletes a chapter or section.
                                Delete with care, PolyGlot has no undo! Chapters and sections can be 
                                moved up and down sequentially using the up and down arrow buttons to 
                                the right of the list.<br>
                                <br>
                                The name field allows you to name your chapter/section.<br>
                                <br>
                                The text field allows you to write out grammar rules. Text format can
                                be modified by highlighting text, changing the values of the font menu
                                above the text box, and clicking Apply. If your language uses RTL
                                writing, it will display as such here when you select your conlang's
                                font in the font dropdown.<br>
                                <br>
                                The Spoken Example menu allows you to record and play back speech in
                                your conlang. This is especially useful when your language uses
                                particular tones or inflections that it is difficult to describe in
                                simple text. To delete the spoken record, the trashcan icon to the
                                right can be clicked.<br>
