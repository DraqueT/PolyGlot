                                source</a>
                            tool set that helps to build constructed languages! PolyGlot
                            is a project that I have been working on for some time, and it
                            continues to become more stable and capable with each release. If you
                            have ideas, find bugs, or have any comments at all, please feel free to
                            email me at <a href="mailto:draquemail@gmail.com">draquemail@gmail.com</a> or
                            post them on <a href="https://github.com/DraqueT/PolyGlot/issues">PolyGlot's issues page</a>!</div>

                        <h1><a name="-----_ii_-----"></a>WHAT’S NEW</h1>
                        <div align ="left"><br>Hey, all! Welcome to version 3.0 of PolyGlot! I have put a massive amount of effort into this one, so I hope that everyone enjoys it. Two elements have been my focus this time more than anything else. 
                            <br><br>
                            1) PolyGlot is now upgraded past Java 8. This means that I can not compile to runnable images, and you will no longer have to worry about having Java on your system* to run the program. It can now be run after it is downloaded, regardless of whether you have the JVM installed. It also fixes a lot of bugs surrounding fonts and general OS integration that have been left to languish in Java 8. This will make for a much smoother ride as we go forward. It also means that you will need to download the correct version PolyGlot for your OS, so please be aware. The dmg file is for OSX, the deb file for Linux, and the exe for Windows. Each may be used to install for your respective system.
                            <br><br>
                            2) I have done a LOT of work on the Auto Conjugation system. There were a couple of frustrating bugs that have been ironed out, but there is also a significant new feature. The Simplified Auto-conjugation window is now available to be selected. If you have a single transformation per word form that is applied universally, then this feature will make life many, many times simpler for you. Additionally, there are buttons on this screen which will automatically set up prefix and postfix style conjugation patterns in regex for you. On both the Simplified and Classic Auto-conjugation screens is a menu button which opens the conjugation test window. This will allow you to apply the selected rule to any text it is given, with debug-information below which lays out the exact path PolyGlot took to conjugate your word. For anyone looking to create complex conjugation rules, this tool should be invaluable.
                            <br><br>
                            Additional features include an integrated Swadesh list import tool and a recovery tool. The Swadesh import feature will allow you to pull template words into your lexicon which are based on a list of very basic words. Additionally, you may write your own list which can be read and populated from later. The recovery tool protects your files in the case that your computer loses power or freezes just as it is saving your work. If this happens, you will be prompted to load from a local recovery file the next time PolyGlot opens.
                            <br><br>
                            * With the exception of print to PDF and CSV functionality. The libraries used for this are firmly entrenched in J8, though I am hoping it will eventually move forward.
                        <br><br>

                            adjectives and any other types of words your language uses should
                            be created here. Once created, they will populate in the drop down
                            boxes of the main screen. You can name the types and add notes as is
                            appropriate. Types can be added and deleted with the respective buttons
                            on the above screen.<br>

                            <br>It is worth noting that <i>classes</i> of words (such as gender) should
                            not be created here. Their creation is handled elsewhere in PloyGlot and covered
                            later in this document.

                            ".*ru$" would tell PolyGlot that all words of a given type must end in
                            the characters "ru". The pattern shown in the above illustration enforces
                            the rule that verbs must end with the character for "lo" in Lodenkur.<br>

                            forms of words. Most commonly, verbs will be conjugated to show present
                            vs. past tense, but there are many different ways that a conjugation
                            can encode meaning in a language. It is in the cases of a more complex
                            system of conjugation/declension that the system in PolyGlot shines.</div>

                            Some languages have non dimensional conjugations, such as gerunds.
                            To create these, simply select the non-dimensional check-box as shown

                            Non-dimensional conjugations will be single forms, unattached to
                            dimensional forms such as tense.

                            One of the more complex features to
                            PolyGlot is the Auto-generation system for conjugations and declensions.
                            This section goes through a basic setup to create a conjugation system.
                            The dictionary used here as an example is included along with PolyGlot
                            as the file exampleAutoGen.pgt. For those of you unfamiliar with
                            regular expressions, links to excellent tutorials exist in the <a href="readme.html#ADDITIONAL_RESOURCES">Additional Resources</a>
                            section of this document. Additionally, there are example dictionaries
                            included with the download of PolyGlot (in the Example Lexicons folder)
                            which may be helpful with some common patterns. For those of you who 
                            who are into infixes, examples are given on how to set this up!<br></div>

                            Before continuing, consider how much complexity you will need for your word forms. Is conjugation a one step affair in your language?
                            Is it a simple swap of one pattern on the end or beginning of your words? If so, consider using the Simplified version of the 
                            auto-generation tool, which can be switched to by clicking the radio button illustrated above (which exists on the top of the 
                            auto-generation window).

                            The Simplified Auto-Generation screen allows for fast and simple creation of basic auto-conjugation settings. If your language has 
                            simple rules for the generation of word forms, you may find this tool less cumbersome than the classic view. The left side of the 
                            window is taken up by a list of all conjugations. Only past and present exist in the example given. To the right are a few options.
                            
                            <br><br>First is the <b>Disable Wordform</b> checkbox. Selecting this tells PolyGlot to ignore this particular conjugation. This can 
                            be useful in cases where conjugations are created dimensionally in ways that you do not need. For example, perhaps both tense and 
                            certainty of actions are encoded in your language, but all actions in the past have positive certainty. In this case, you would 
                            select Disable Wordform for the conjugation past-uncertain.
                            
                            <br><br>Second is the <b>Regex Pattern</b> field. Regex (regular expressions) represent a powerful tool which can identify patterns. These
                            are used in PolyGlot. Simple prefix/suffix cases are covered here, but if you would like to get more ambitious, please check out 
                            the links in <a href="readme.html#ADDITIONAL_RESOURCES">Additional Resources</a>. Here, the "$" character is placed in the regex field.
                            This character represents the end of a word, so it will result in a suffix being added.
                            
                            <br><br>The last field is the <b>Replacement Text</b> field. Text placed here will replace any parts of the original word which match the
                            regex pattern above. Here, the very end of the word (which does not include any characters) will be replaced with "-PASTO". Because the $ 
                            character only matches the end of a word itself rather than characters within it, it will add "-PASTO" as a suffix when conjugating the 
                            past tense.
                            
                            <br><br>The two buttons on the bottom are <b>Prefix Template</b> and <b>Postfix Template</b>. These will populate the regex field with a
                            pattern telling PolyGlot to conjugate the currently selected conjugation/declension by either adding the replacement text to the beginning 
                            or the end of a base word, respectively.

                        <h2>Classic Auto-Generation Setup</h2><br>

                        <div align ="left">The Classic Auto-Generation setup is significantly more complex than the simplified menu. 
                            It is both more powerful and has a steeper learning curve. If your language has complex conjugation or
                            declension rules however, this will give you the power you need to implement it. If you are using the Classic
                            Auto-Generation, please also take note of the <a href="#CONJTEST">Test Menu</a>. It will prove invaluable to making certain that your 
                            rules behave in the manner which you expect them to.<br><br>
                            
                            A number of controls are presented here. In the leftmost column, you see
                            every possible conjugation of the selected word type (verb in this
                            example case). The verb selected to create a conjugation rule is past tense
                            verbs that are certain and positive. Every possible combination of conjugations
                            is present in this list. A combination can be disabled by clicking the "Disable
                            Wordform" checkbox.<br>

                            To create transformation rules click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">+</span>
                            button beneath the rules column. In the example picture, one rule,
                            "Past, Cert, Pos rule" has been created. The rightmost section of the window contains
                            the rule's properties. Of note is that you may create as many rules as you like
                            for each conjugation. They will be applied in the order that they appear in the rules
                            list. Their order can be adjusted using the up and down arrow buttons immediately
                            to the right of the Rules list.<br>

                            The rule's name can be set to anything, and is just label
                            to help remember what precisely it applies to. The
                            rule regex immediately below its name dictates which words the rule applies to.
                            In the example, I use the regex ".*" which applies to everything. If you used the match
                            regex ".*ru$", the rule would only be applied to rules ending with "ru". Regex is a
                            very powerful system, but can be confusing at first. There are links at the end of this
                            document which lead to helpful guides with it if you are unfamiliar.<br>

                            <br>
                            Beneath this is the Transformations table. Each rule may have as many
                            transformations as you like. They will be applied as with the rules themselves,
                            they are applied in the order which they appear. For conjugations with complex
                            transformations, this can make things much simpler.
                            Here, there is only one rule. As you can see, PolyGlot natively applies any 
                            script directly to the column to allow for natively legible characters (scripts
                            must be imported as fonts, which is covered elsewhere in this document). The left
                            column is the Regex value for the transformation. This is the section of the word
                            that PolyGlot will target to replace. In my example it looks for the character "lo" in 
                            my script at the end of words. The right column contains the text that will replace 
                            the text targeted in the left column.<br><br>

                            Here is the complete logic that this rule will result in when PolyGlot looks to create
                            conjugations for verbs:

                            <ul>
                                <li>Is this word a verb? If so, continue.</li>
                                <li>Create a Past Certain Positive conjugation field for the word</li>
                                <li>Are rules available which the word matches the rule regex fits? If so, apply those rules to the word</li>
                                <li>For each rule which applies to the word, apply each transformation in the order they appear</li>
                                <li>For each transformation, target matching regex text and overwrite it with the replacement text</li>
                                <li>The resulting text is your fully conjugated word-form.</li>
                            </ul></div>

                            Often times it can be useful to filter conjugation rules by the value of a word's class.
                            For example, perhaps female nouns decline differently than male nouns. If this is the 
                            case, defined class values (Classes covered in the next section) will appear in a filter
                            box when creating rules. To apply a rule to words of all class values, simply choose "All." 
                            To apply it to specific class values, deselect all and select the values to filter for. NOTE: 
                            <b>every</b> value checked must match for the rule's transformations to be applied to a given

                            The auto-generation test menu is an invaluable too when creating more complex conjugation and 
                            declension rules. It provides both a test bed for the generation process and complex debug
                            output to show you exactly what is taking place when the new word forms are generated. To access
                            this menu, click the Test button in the upper right-hand corner of the Auto-Conjugation Setup

                            In the example setup, there are two conjugations: past and present. Shown are rules for the past 
                            conjugation. Selected is the rule "male starts with b." The match class value is set to male, and 
                            the regex match is set to "b.*", so this rule will apply only to words of class male that start with
                            the character 'b'. Within the rule are three transformation rules. First, appending "-PASTO" to the 
                            end of the word. Second, replacing the 'b' that the word begins with with "MALE-". Third, replacing
                            the trailing 'O' character (added by the first transformation) with a '-'.<br><br>
                            Clicking the Test button will allow us to test the entire past conjugation.

                            language.<br><br></div>

                            In this example, I have added two classes, gender and distance. To the distance class, 
                            I have added three values: touching, near, and far. To the right, all of the parts 
                            of speech for this language are listed. Only nouns are checked, so the distance class will

                            - Local Language

                            The natural language that you are using while writing your
                            dictionary/language rules.<br>

                            - Author/Copyright Info<br>

                            Here you can include any information that you the creator want packaged with
                            your language, including personal contact information, copyright

                            <br>
                            - Conlang Font<br>
                            
                            Many ConLangs use nonstandard character sets, and it is sometimes
                            easiest to simply create a font yourself and map these characters to
                            standard Unicode characters. To load a font, click the Conlang Font
                            button and select from the list of locally installed fonts. All Conlang
                            fields will appear in the appropriate font. As a note, if you wish to
                            send your saved dictionary to a friend who is also using PolyGlot, you
                            must also send them the font, or they will receive an error message
                            when they load your dictionary, and see standard characters, rather
                            than your custom font.<br>
                            <br>
                            If you would prefer to directly import your conlang font file, or if
                            you are having versioning issues with it (see warning below), you
                            can import them directly from the menu. Simply click Tools->Import 
                            Font, and PolyGlot will load it without the need to install it to your 
                            OS at all.<br><br>
                            <span style="font-weight:bold; color:red">LINUX WARNING:</span><br>
                            If you use a font with ligatures, please use the manual load option
                            (tools->import font) to import your font. Due to a persistent bug in
                            Java, loading in the typical way will cause your ligatures to be 
                            ignored. This will be addressed in future releases of PolyGlot.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            - Local Font<br>
                            This will allow you to change the font that your local language is 
                            displayed in. In some cases, certain diacritic marks are useful to
                            have access to when creating romanizations or other scenarios.
                            <br><br>
                            - Refresh Fonts<br>
                            If you install a new version of a font, this button will need to be 
                            clicked to refresh which version PolyGlot uses. This is because fonts
                            are embedded into languages (ensuring that friends you send your 
                            language to will be able to see them properly even without installing
                            your fonts).
                            <br><br>
                            - Alphabetical Order<br>
                            This allows you to create a custom
                            alphabetical order for the
                            characters used in your language. Simply list the characters in your
                            alphabetical order in this text box, and PolyGlot will respect it when
                            reordering words in the dictionary. Any characters not provided here
                            will be ordered in standard fashion (as decided by your operating
                            system). Here, I have set the alphabetic order to follow qwerty. This
                            will order the dictionary and any alphabetically ordered fields with
                            the order you provide.<br>
                            <br>
                            - Kerning<br>
                            The default value for kerning is set to 0. Making this larger or smaller 
                            (into negatives) allows you to edit space between characters.<br>
                            <b>WARNING:</b> Kerning values over 0.0 will cause PolyGlot to ignore
                            ligatures. This is due to a problem with Java rendering that will not 
                            likely be fixed. If you are using a custom font, adjust spacing there.

                            done by selecting words in the main window's lexicon, and clicking the

                            are both logically and lexically related, so I have grouped them

                            because they are lexically related to one another. The word for "hand"

                            The Swadesh List tool can be helpful when beginning a language and looking for a place to start. Swadesh lists are lists 
                            of the most fundamental words in many early languages. If these are completed, deriving newer words and expanding your
                            language may prove to be much easier. PolyGlot comes with a few predefined Swadesh lists. Selecting Tools->Swadesh Lists

                            Additionally, you may choose to load a custom Swadesh list. If this option is selected, an open file dialog will appear. 
                            Simply select any line delimited plaintext or unicode text file to import. (Note: Comma delimited will not work correctly, 
                            these files must be delimited by a new line or carriage return between each word to be imported).

                            If you have more columns than are provided for in PolyGlot, multiple
                            columns can be imported to a single PolyGlot field. Simply enter the

                            These can be easily renamed to their appropriate values post import

                            the word you add as a parent has its own etymological roots, this will be

                            NOTE: PolyGlot will prevent you from adding words as their own parents, or

                        This can be found by clicking the Phonology and Text menu button on the
                        left of PolyGlot's menu. It is the first of the three menus. New rows can
                        be added with the Add button, and selected columns can be deleted with
                        the Delete button. The Character(s) row represents one character or a
                        series of characters that make up a sound or phoneme. The Pronunciation
                        column represents the sound or phoneme associated with the contents of
                        the Character(s) column of the same row. This allows PolyGlot to
                        auto-generate pronunciations for you when you create new words, and can
                        save a lot of time. Both columns are compatible with regular
                        expressions (explained below).<br>
                        <br>
                        Of note is that both upper and lower cases must be entered into the
                        pronunciation guide unless both the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ignore
                            Case</span> option and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Disable
                            Proc Regex</span> options are selected.<br>
                        <br>
                        The order that the sets appear in represents their <span style="font-style: italic;">priority</span>.
                        Higher position means higher priority. In the example, you can see that
                        the pair "gh-&gt;j" is higher than both "g-&gt;guh" and "h-&gt;h". This
                        means that if PolyGlot encounters "gh", it will attempt to create a
                        valid pronunciation using the "gh-&gt;j" rule before either of the
                        others. By selecting a row and clicking the up or down arrow to the
                        right of the guide, you can move a set to higher or lower priorities in
                        the guide. <br>
                        
                        <br>
                        In addition to the basic functionality, the pronunciation guide is
                        compatible with regular expressions. For example, if you added the pair
                        "^th" -&gt; "θ", it would replace "th" <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span>
                        when it appeared at the beginning of a word. This allows for deep

                        This enables a powerful function in PolyGlot, which will comb through a word 
                        multiple times, applying new pronunciations so long as there are more transformations
                        defined in the left column that might apply. <b>Clicking this will also enable lookahead

                            the one above, except that the dictionary is based on local language
                            words, and in the alphabetic order that the user’s machine defaults to.<br>
                            <br>
                            The Print Grammar option tells PolyGlot to include all chapters that
                            you have written in your Grammar Guide. Formatting choices such as
                            preserving inline conlang fonts and color are preserved. The Grammar
                            Guide will have its own chapter in the ToC, with subchapters listed
                            beneath it representing the sections created within your guide.<br>

                            The Print Logographs option is not currently available. If you use

                            logographic engine in PolyGlot, drop me a line, and I’ll make it
                            happen. As of now, I don’t believe there are any users leveraging this
                            functionality.<br>

                            The Print All Conjugations option will print a labeled list of all

                            appropriate for their part of speech.<br>

                            The Print Etymology Trees option will print graphical etymology trees

                            with the goal of representing each unique sound that can be part of
                            spoken language. If you’re looking to try out new sounds or find
                            combinations of sounds that build a coherent orthography for a new
                            language, this can be very useful. Try playing around and finding which
                            sounds flow into one another and before long, you’ll have the sound and
                            feel of a new language. It can be accessed by clicking

                            The Interactive IPA chart is a useful tool for establishing the
                            orthography of your language. It is separated by tabs into Vowels,
                            Pulmonic Consonants, Non-Pulmonic Consonants, and Other/Affricates. If
                            you click on any of the characters, PolyGlot will play the associated
                            sound and copy the character into the textbox in the bottom of the

                                The language reversion tool allows you to roll your language file 
                                back to a previously saved state. This can be enormously helpful in 
                                the case of disaster recovery, or if you accidentally made/saved a 
                                bulk operation on your lexicon.<br><br>
                                <img src="assets/revert01.png" alt=""><br>
                                The reversion menu can be accessed by clicking Tools->Revert Language, 
                                as shown above.<br><br>
                                <img src="assets/revert02.png" alt=""><br>
                                In the reversion menu, you will see prior saves (limit of prior saves
                                retained found in options menu, with 0 as infinite). They are listed
                                in in descending order of save time/date. To revert to any given 
                                state, select it and click the Revert To button.<br><br>
                                If you modify and save from this point, a <i>new</i> reversion point 
                                will be created rather than saving over the existing one you loaded. 
                                Once a reversion point is created, it is fixed in time.<br><br>
                                <img src="assets/revert03.png" alt=""><br>
                                PolyGlot defaults to saving 10 prior save versions. Versions older 
                                than this will be discarded. You can increase or decrease this number
                                in the PolyGlot options menu (Tools->Options). The value 0 means that
                                PolyGlot will not limit the number of saved versions. Take care when
                                setting the value to 0. If you have a large language file and save
                                frequently, this can make the size of your language save file balloon
                                quickly.

                                Chapters cannot be nested. The + button adds new sections to the
                                currently selected chapter. The - button deletes a chapter or section.
                                Delete with care, PolyGlot has no undo! Chapters and sections can be 
                                moved up and down sequentially using the up and down arrow buttons to

                                above the text box, and clicking Apply. If your language uses RTL
                                writing, it will display as such here when you select your conlang's

                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regular expressions can be pretty complex, but
                                are immensely powerful. Below are a few links that are very helpful in
                                learning good RegEx practices.<br>
