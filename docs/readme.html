                            tool set that helps to build constructed languages! PolyGlot
                            is a project that I have been working on for some time, and it
                            continues to become more stable and capable with each release. If you
                            have ideas, find bugs, or have any comments at all, please feel free to
                            email me at <a href="mailto:draquemail@gmail.com">draquemail@gmail.com</a> or

                        <div align ="left"><br>Heyo, everyone! I've got a new version of PolyGlot with some nice new 
                            features to share! On top of the most obvious improvements (the declension display and the 
                            lexical checking tool), I've taken some time to seriously rework and improve the automated 
                            testing in PolyGlot. It started as a tiny side project, but the size at this point 
                            absolutely requires a testing suite to help keep bugs down. Additionally, there are a lot
                            of tiny life improvement changes and annoying error fixes that are not listed below (for 
                            a full list, check out the issues page linked above and check out what's been closed).

                            As always, please enjoy, everyone!

                        <a name="INSTALLATION"></a>
                        <h1>INSTALLATION</h1><br>
                        <div align ="left">PolyGlot is a Java program, and requires the Java Virtual Machine 1.8
                            or higher to run. This is available for free at <a href="https://java.com/en/download/index.jsp">https://java.com/en/download/index.jsp</a>.
                            PolyGlot will run on any version of Java newer than Java 1.8, but it is
                            recommended that you have the highest version your operating system
                            will support. NOTE: Most operating systems should be able to unzip files,
                            but programs such as <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7Zip</a> are available online for free.<br>
                            PolyGlot <span style="font-style: italic;">MUST</span> be
                            unzipped to function correctly. It cannot be run from within the zip
                            file that you've downloaded, and many of its functions will fail in
                            unpredictable ways if you attempt to run it directly from the zip file.</div>
                        <br><br>
                        WINDOWS:
                        <br>
                        <div align ="left">If Java is installed, you only need to unzip the contents of the
                            PolyGlot program to a folder and double click the frontend executable file.
                            This will associate PGT filetypes with the frontend so that double clicking
                            opens them correctly. <br><br>
                            <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS WITH WINRAR</span>:
                            WinRAR tends to associate itself with jar files as archives. This keeps them
                            from executing properly. Follow these instructions to correct the issue.<br></div>
                        <div align ="left"><ul>
                                <li>Open WinRAR</li>
                                <li>Click Options->Settings</li>
                                <li>Click the Integration tab</li>
                                <li>Under "Associate WinRAR with," <i>un</i>check the JAR checkbox</li>
                                <li>Click OK and close WinRAR.</li>
                            </ul>
                            After this, simply double click PolyGlot.jar and it should open up for you!</div>
                        <br><br>
                        MAC:<br>

                        <br><br>
                        LINUX:<br>
                        <div align ="left">Simply unzip the files where you like and run! For convenience, there is a script
                            which opens PolyGlot included.

                            <br><br>
                            <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE FOR LINUX USERS</span>: Before
                            using PolyGlot, most users of Linux will have to make the jar file
                            executable. To do this, open a command prompt, navigate to the folder
                            you have extracted PolyGlot to, and enter the following line: "chmod +x
                            PolyGlot.jar". Depending on your settings, you may need to enter your
                            admin password to do this.<br>
                            <br>
                            Additionally, some builds of Linux come with OpenJDK 7, which does not
                            include JavaFX (a necessary component for PolyGlot's interface). Please
                            upgrade to OpenJDK 8 if you're using Linux and still on 7. This can be
                            done through the Package Manager and search for JavaFX or the full
                            name, java-openjfx.<br>
                            <br>
                            An example <i>PolyGlot.desktop</i> file is provided, and can be copied
                            in <i>~/.local/share/applications/</i> so that PolyGlot can be launched
                            from the menu or application launcher. The paths of files in entries
                            <i>Exec</i> and <i>Icon</i> must be adapter to the location where you
                            installed PolyGlot.
                            <br>
                            <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE FOR ARCH LINUX USERS: </span>You
                            must install JFX manually to properly use PolyGlot.<br>
                            <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE FOR FEDORA USERS: </span>

                            if the word would otherwise be illegal.<br>

                            ".*ru$" would tell PolyGlot that all words of a given type must end in
                            the characters "ru". The pattern shown in the above illustration enforces
                            the rule that verbs must end with the character for "lo" in Lodenkur.<br>

                            vs. past tense, but there are many different ways that a conjugation
                            can encode meaning in a language. It is in the cases of a more complex

                            which may be helpful with some common patterns. For those of you who 
                            who are into infixes, examples are given on how to set this up!<br></div>

                        <div align ="left">Before autogeneration rules can be created, conjugations/declensions
                            for a type must exist (as explained in <a href="readme.html#-_ConjugationsDeclensions">Conjugations/Declensions</a>).
                            Once this is done, go to the Types tab, select the part of speech to
                            create autogeneration rules for, and click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Conj/Decl Autogeneration</span> button.<br></div>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <img alt="" src="assets/autoGen2.png"><br>
                        <br>
                        <div align ="left">A number of controls are presented here. In the leftmost column, you see
                            every possible conjugation of the selected word type (verb in this
                            example case). The verb selected to create a conjugation rule is past tense
                            verbs that are certain and positive. Every possible combination of conjugations
                            is present in this list. A combination can be disabled by clicking the "Disable
                            Wordform" checkbox.<br>

                            To create transformation rules click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">+</span>
                            button beneath the rules column. In the example picture, one rule,
                            "Past, Cert, Pos rule" has been created. The rightmost section of the window contains
                            the rule's properties. Of note is that you may create as many rules as you like
                            for each conjugation. They will be applied in the order that they appear in the rules
                            list. Their order can be adjusted using the up and down arrow buttons immediately
                            to the right of the Rules list.<br>

                            The rule's name can be set to anything, and is just label
                            to help remember what precisely it applies to. The
                            rule regex immediately below its name dictates which words the rule applies to.
                            In the example, I use the regex ".*" which applies to everything. If you used the match
                            regex ".*ru$", the rule would only be aplied to rules ending with "ru". Regex is a
                            very powerful system, but can be confusing at first. There are links at the end of this
                            document which lead to helpful guides with it if you are unfamiliar.<br>

                            <br>
                            Beneath this is the Transformations table. Each rule may have as many
                            transformations as you like. They will be applied as with the rules themselves,
                            they are applied in the order which they appear. For conjugations with complex
                            transformations, this can make things much simpler.
                            Here, there is only one rule. As you can see, PolyGlot natively applies any 
                            script directly to the column to allow for natively legible characters (scripts
                            must be imported as fonts, which is covered elsewhere in this document). The left
                            column is the Regex value for the transformation. This is the section of the word
                            that PolyGlot will target to replace. In my example it looks for the character "lo" in 
                            my script at the end of words. The right column contains the text that will replace 
                            the text targeted in the left column.<br><br>

                            Here is the complete logic that this rule will result in when PolyGlot looks to create
                            conjugations for verbs:

                            <ul>
                                <li>Is this word a verb? If so, continue.</li>
                                <li>Create a Past Certain Positive conjugation field for the word</li>
                                <li>Are rules available which the word matches the rule regex fits? If so, apply those rules to the word</li>
                                <li>For each rule which applies to the word, apply each transformation in the order they appear</li>
                                <li>For each transformation, target matching regex text and overwrite it with the replacement text</li>
                                <li>The resulting text is your fully conjugated word-form.</li>
                            </ul></div>

                            <b>FILTERING CONJUGATION RULES BY CLASS</b><br><br>
                            Often times it can be useful to filter conjugation rules by the value of a word's class.
                            For example, perhaps female nouns decline differently than male nouns. If this is the 
                            case, defined class values (Classes covered in the next section) will appear in a filter
                            box when creating rules. To apply a rule to words of all class values, simply choose "All." 
                            To apply it to specific class values, deselect all and select the values to filter for. NOTE: 
                            <b>every</b> value checked must match for the rule's transformations to be applied to a given 
                            word.

                            Word class is most familiar as grammatical gender. Classes can be added to words by 
                            clicking the Lexical Classes button on the main menu. This functionality replaces the 
                            hard coded Gender module in prior versions. As many classes as you like, with as many 
                            values as you find necessary may be added to words. If your language used gender, it will 
                            automatically be converted to a word class, and you will notice no difference in your 
                            language.<br><br></div>

                            Many ConLangs use nonstandard character sets, and it is sometimes
                            easiest to simply create a font yourself and map these characters to
                            standard Unicode characters. To load a font, click the Conlang Font
                            button and select from the list of locally installed fonts. All Conlang
                            fields will appear in the appropriate font. As a note, if you wish to
                            send your saved dictionary to a friend who is also using PolyGlot, you
                            must also send them the font, or they will receive an error message
                            when they load your dictionary, and see standard characters, rather
                            than your custom font.<br>

                            If you would prefer to directly import your conlang font file, or if

                            If you create a custom font/script, remember to uninstall old copies
                            of the font when moving to a new version. PolyGlot cannot detect
                            the difference between multiple different versions of your font
                            with the same name in your OS' font folder, and having multiple
                            versions with the same name can lead to erratic behavior.<br><br>

                            If you use a font with ligatures, please use the manual load option
                            (tools->import font) to import your font. Due to a persistent bug in
                            Java, loading in the typical way will cause your ligatures to be 
                            ignored. This will be addressed in future releases of PolyGlot.

                            - Local Font<br>
                            This will allow you to change the font that your local language is 
                            displayed in. In some cases, certain dicratic marks are useful to 
                            have access to when creating romanizations or other scenarios.

                            - Alphabetical Order<br>
                            This allows you to create a custom
                            alphabetical order for the
                            characters used in your language. Simply list the characters in your
                            alphabetical order in this text box, and PolyGlot will respect it when
                            reordering words in the dictionary. Any characters not provided here
                            will be ordered in standard fashion (as decided by your operating
                            system). Here, I have set the alphabetic order to follow qwerty. This
                            will order the dictionary and any alphabetically ordered fields with
                            the order you provide.<br>

                            The default value for kerning is set to 0. Making this larger or smaller 
                            (into negatives) allows you to edit space between characters.<br>
                            <b>WARNING:</b> Kerning values over 0.0 will cause PolyGlot to ignore
                            ligatures. This is due to a problem with Java rendering that will not 
                            likely be fixed. If you are using a custom font, adjust spacing there.

                            or the CSV file you're using has commas as delimiters, you may ignore

                            The Etymology Engine allows you to create and visually graph complex 
                            systems of etymology and lexical lineage within your language. To access
                            it, select the word you would like to work on in the Lexicon section
                            of PolyGlot and click the Etymology button (pictured above).<br><br>
                            
                            <img src='assets/ety02.png' alt=''><br><br>
                            
                            On the screen above, we can enter etymological parents to our selected word. 
                            The top left menu for Internal Parents allows parents to be added from within
                            your language. The dropdown will populate with all the words from your language.
                            Once a word is selected, the visualization to the right will update and a new 
                            (empty) dropdown will appear in case you want to add additional parents. If 
                            the word you add as a parent has its own etymological roots, this will be
                            reflected in the diagram.<br>
                            NOTE: PolyGlot will prevent you from adding words as their own parents, or 
                            creating logical loops. A word may never be its own ancestor.<br><br>
                            
                            To the bottom left is the External Parents interface. Here, you can add and 
                            remove etymological parents which exist outside your current language. Click 
                            the + button to add additional parents.<br><br>
                            
                            In both the internal and external menus, a - button will appear next to all 
                            current parents. Click it will delete that parent from the currently selected 
                            word. Notes/images can be added in a free text menu as well.

                        <br>

                        <div align ="left">The above image shows the Phonemic Orthology guide. 
                        This can be found by clicking the Phonology and Text menu button on the
                        left of PolyGlot's menu. It is the first of the three menus. New rows can
                        be added with the Add button, and selected columns can be deleted with
                        the Delete button. The Character(s) row represents one character or a
                        series of characters that make up a sound or phoneme. The Pronunciation
                        column represents the sound or phoneme associated with the contents of
                        the Character(s) column of the same row. This allows PolyGlot to
                        auto-generate pronunciations for you when you create new words, and can
                        save a lot of time. Both columns are compatible with regular
                        expressions (explained below).<br>
                        <br>
                        Of note is that both upper and lower cases must be entered into the
                        pronunciation guide unless both the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ignore
                            Case</span> option and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Disable
                            Proc Regex</span> options are selected.<br>
                        <br>
                        The order that the sets appear in represents their <span style="font-style: italic;">priority</span>.
                        Higher position means higher priority. In the example, you can see that
                        the pair "gh-&gt;j" is higher than both "g-&gt;guh" and "h-&gt;h". This
                        means that if PolyGlot encounters "gh", it will attempt to create a
                        valid pronunciation using the "gh-&gt;j" rule before either of the
                        others. By selecting a row and clicking the up or down arrow to the
                        right of the guide, you can move a set to higher or lower priorities in
                        the guide. <br>
                        
                        <br>
                        In addition to the basic functionality, the pronunciation guide is
                        compatible with regular expressions. For example, if you added the pair
                        "^th" -&gt; "θ", it would replace "th" <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span>
                        when it appeared at the beginning of a word. This allows for deep
                        orthographies to be easily be created. Links in the references section
                        of this document lead to good regular expression tutorials.<br>
                        
                        <br>
                        The last element of the pronunciation guide is the Recurse Patterns button. 
                        This enables a powerful function in PolyGlot, which will comb through a word 
                        multiple times, applying new pronunciations so long as there are more transformations
                        defined in the left column that might apply. <b>Clicking this will also enable lookahead
                        and lookbehind in regex patterns.</b>

                                than this will be discarded. You can increase or decrease this number
                                in the PolyGlot options menu (Tools->Options). The value 0 means that
                                PolyGlot will not limit the number of saved versions. Take care when
                                setting the value to 0. If you have a large language file and save
                                frequently, this can make the size of your language save file balloon
                                quickly.

                                On the left is the chapter and section tree. By clicking the Chapter
                                button, a new chapter is added below the currently selected position.
                                Chapters cannot be nested. The + button adds new sections to the
                                currently selected chapter. The - button deletes a chapter or section.

                                The name field allows you to name your chapter/section.<br>
                                <br>
                                The text field allows you to write out grammar rules. Text format can
                                be modified by highlighting text, changing the values of the font menu
                                above the text box, and clicking Apply. If your language uses RTL
                                writing, it will display as such here when you select your conlang's
                                font in the font dropdown.<br>
                                <br>
                                The Spoken Example menu allows you to record and play back speech in
                                your conlang. This is especially useful when your language uses
                                particular tones or inflections that it is difficult to describe in
                                simple text.<br>

                                The following sites are excellent for creating your
                                own fonts for use within PolyGlot, and all fonts created with them
                                should be fully compatible (although custom kerning is still a future
                                feature). The custom font for Lodenkur, Kukun Linear A, was created
                                with Fontstruct, although future versions will likely be created with
                                FontContstructor.<br>

                                into language construction for the first time. Please check them out!
                                The first two are resources to read through yourself, and the last is a
                                community of very friendly people who are passionate about creating and

                                are immensely powerful. Below are a few links that are very helpful in
